    "pipeline-panel-fe-description": "The feature extraction pipeline helps you understand and prepare your sensor data for analysis. It doesn't train a model itself, but it's a crucial first step in the process. Here's how it works:\nSelect the building blocks: You have the freedom to choose the components that make up your pipeline. This includes:\nDigital Signal Processing: Techniques to clean up and enhance your raw sensor data, like removing noise or isolating specific signals. Think of it like fine-tuning your radio to get a clear signal.\nFeature Extraction: This is where you extract meaningful information from the processed data. Imagine calculating the average temperature from a series of readings, or identifying patterns in a sound wave.\nSampling Techniques: Control how data points are selected from your sensor stream. This helps manage the amount of data being processed and can be important for capturing key events.\nMachine Learning Algorithms (for Feature Engineering): You can even use some machine learning algorithms to help automatically create new, more informative features from your existing data. This can reveal hidden relationships and improve the accuracy of later modeling.\nFast iteration: The pipeline remembers the results of each step. This means you can quickly experiment with different settings and combinations without having to reprocess everything from scratch. It's like having a shortcut to test out different recipes for your data.\n\nBy using the Feature Extraction Pipeline, you can:\n\nVisualize your data: See what your sensor data looks like after each processing step, helping you identify trends and anomalies.\nPrepare data for modeling: Create the right inputs for training machine learning models later on.\nGain insights: Uncover hidden patterns and relationships in your data, even without a full-blown model.",
    "pipeline-panel-automl-description": "AutoML Pipeline: Find the Best Model Automatically the AutoML pipeline takes the guesswork out of building machine learning models for your sensor data. You still have control over how your data is prepared, but SensiML's powerful algorithms handle the heavy lifting of finding the best model and settings.\nHere's how it works:\n\nFeature Engineering: Just like the Feature Extraction Pipeline, you choose how your raw sensor data is processed and transformed into meaningful features. This includes selecting digital signal processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and sampling strategies.\nAutomated Machine Learning (AutoML):  This is where the magic happens. SensiML's AutoML engine explores a vast array of machine learning algorithms and fine-tunes their parameters to find the optimal solution for your specific data and goals.\nBalance Accuracy and Efficiency:  You can guide the AutoML process by setting constraints on model size and complexity. This allows you to find the sweet spot between high accuracy and efficient resource usage. For example, you might discover that a slightly less accurate model uses significantly less memory and processing power, which is crucial for many embedded devices.\nBenefits of using the AutoML Pipeline:\nSave time and effort: No need to manually experiment with countless model types and settings.\nOptimize for your needs: Find models that meet your accuracy requirements while staying within resource limits.\nDiscover new possibilities: AutoML can uncover surprising solutions and model architectures you might not have considered.",
    "pipeline-panel-custom-description": "Custom Pipeline: Take Full Control of Your Model\n\nThe Custom pipeline puts you in the driver's seat, giving you complete control over the model building process. You decide exactly how your data is processed, which machine learning algorithm is used, and how the final model behaves.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nFeature Engineering:  Just like the other pipelines, you have the freedom to choose how your sensor data is transformed into meaningful features. This includes selecting digital signal processing techniques, feature extraction methods, and sampling strategies.\nSelect Your Algorithm: Choose from a variety of machine learning algorithms, each with its own strengths and characteristics. You can select the algorithm that best suits your specific task and data.\nFine-tune the Model:  Adjust the parameters of your chosen algorithm to optimize its performance. This allows you to tailor the model to your exact needs and achieve the desired balance between accuracy and resource usage.\nBenefits of using the Custom Pipeline:\nMaximum Flexibility: You have complete control over every aspect of the model building process.\nDeep Understanding: Gain a deeper understanding of how your model works and why it makes certain predictions.\nCustomization: Tailor the model to your specific application and hardware constraints.\nExperimentation: Explore different algorithms and settings to find the optimal solution for your needs.",
